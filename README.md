# Bricks.js

> Momma said, "Stay patient." - Bricks, DJ Carnage

But you don't need to, because Bricks is **a blazing fast masonry layout generator for fixed width elements**.

## Quick Start

```es6
// import Bricks
import bricks from 'bricks.js'

// create an instance
const instance = bricks({
  container: '.container',
  packed: 'data-packed',
  sizes: [
    { columns: 2, gutter: 10 },
    { mq: '768px', columns: 3, gutter: 25 },
    { mq: '1024px', columns: 4, gutter: 50 }
  ]
})

// bind callbacks
instance
  .on('pack', () => console.log('Packed!'))
  .on('resize', () => console.log('Resized!'))
  .on('update', () => console.log('Updated!'))

// start it up
instance
  .resize()     // bind resize handler
  .pack()       // pack initial items

// add new items via AJAX
fetch('path/to.html')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => {
    document.querySelector('.container').appendChild(html)
    instance.update()
  })
```

## Usage

Bricks was developed with a modern JavaScript workflow in mind. To use it, it's recommended you have a build system in place that can transpile ES6, and bundle modules. For a minimal boilerplate that does so, check out [outset](https://github.com/callmecavs/outset).

Follow these steps to get started:

* [Install](#install)
* [Instantiate](#instantiate)
  * [Parameters](#parameters)
* [Events](#events)
* [API](#api)

### Install

Using NPM, install Bricks.js, and add it to your `package.json` dependencies.

```
$ npm install bricks.js --save
```

### Instantiate

Simply import Bricks, then instantiate it.

It's recommended that you assign your Bricks instance to a variable. Using your instance, you can enable the resize handler, bind callback handlers, and accommodate dynamically added elements.

Parameters passed to the constructor are detailed below.

```es6
// import Bricks
import bricks from 'bricks.js'

// create an instance
const instance = bricks({
  container: '.container',
  packed: 'data-packed',
  sizes: [
    { columns: 2, gutter: 10 },
    { mq: '768px', columns: 3, gutter: 25 },
    { mq: '1024px', columns: 4, gutter: 50 }
  ]
})
```

#### Parameters

Note that **all parameters are required**:

* A [container](#container) selector
* A [packed](#packed) attribute
* A [sizes](#sizes) array

##### container

A CSS selector that matches the grid wrapper.

Note that the _direct children of this element must be the grid items_.

```es6
const instance = bricks({
  container: '.selector'
})
```

##### packed

An attribute added to items positioned within the grid.

Note that if the attribute is not prefixed with `data-`, it will be added.

```es6
const instance = bricks({
  packed: 'data-packed'
})
```

##### sizes

An array of objects describing the grid's properties at different breakpoints.

When defining your sizes, note the following:

* Sizes must use _`min-width` media queries_
* Sizes must be listed _smallest to largest_

The size object without the `mq` property is assumed to be your smallest breakpoint, and must appear first.

```es6
// columns - the number of vertical columns
// gutter  - the space (in px) between the columns and grid items

const instance = bricks({
  sizes: [
    { columns: 2, gutter: 10 },
    { mq: '768px', columns: 3, gutter: 25 },
    { mq: '1024px', columns: 4, gutter: 50 }
  ]
})
```

### Events

Bricks returns an instance that is extended with [Knot.js](https://github.com/callmecavs/knot.js), a browser-based event emitter. Use the event emitter syntax to add and remove callbacks associated with the events that Bricks emits.

The event names, and the parameters passed to them (if any), are described below:

#### pack

Fired when all grid items have been packed.

```es6
instance.on('pack', () => {
  // ...
})
```

#### update

Fired when newly added elements have been packed.

```es6
instance.on('update', () => {
  // ...
})
```

#### resize

Fired when browser resizing has caused a new size object to match.

Note that the `pack` event is also fired at this time. Use the `resize` event for code _specific to the size of the grid changing_, not the items being packed.

```es6
instance.on('resize', (size) => {
  // 'size' is the newly matching size object
})
```

### API

Note that **all methods, including those from the event emitter, are chainable**.

Review the [Knot.js](https://github.com/callmecavs/knot.js) documentation for an understanding of the emitter methods.

#### .pack()

Used to pack all elements within the container.

Note that it needs to be called after creating your instance, to pack the initial items.

```es6
// pack all items, using an existing instance
instance.pack()
```

#### .update()

Used to handle dynamically added elements.

Note that `update` is the preferred method for positioning new items within the grid, _assuming the media query hasn't changed_, because it will only operate on items that have not yet been packed (i.e. don't have the `packed` attribute).

```es6
// call the update method, using an existing instance
instance.update()
```

#### .resize()

Used to bind the `resize` handler to the `window` resize event. It should be called _only once_, when creating your instance, to avoid event duplication, and ensure all potential resizing is handled.

Note that the resize handler only fires the `pack` method _if the resulting screen size matches a size parameter other than the current one_.

```es6
// bind the resize handler, using an existing instance
instance.resize()
```

## Browser Support

Bricks depends on the following browser APIs:

* ES5 array methods: [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach), [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
* [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
* [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)

Consequently, it supports the following natively:

* Chrome 24+
* Firefox 23+
* Safari 6.1+
* Opera 15+
* IE 10+
* iOS Safari 7.1+
* Android Browser 4.4+

To support older browsers, consider including [polyfills/shims](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills) for the APIs listed above. There are **no plans to include any in the library**, in the interest of file size.
